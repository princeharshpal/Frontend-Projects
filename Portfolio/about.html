            <h2>Harsh Pal</h2>
            <p class="summary">

                I graduated from Phonics Group of Institutions, Roorkee with a degree in B.tech (Computer Science and
                Engineering) in 2024. During my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in Web Developement &
                Desighning, which laid the groundwork for my career in Web Developement. <br> <br>

                I believe that the projects I have worked on have been the highlight of my Developing journey. I have
                been
                influenced to constantly look for problems around me and solutions to them; for challenges like these
                are what drive me to work relentlessly through sleepless nights for hours on end. And I love every
                moment of them. <br> <br>

                The dedication, eye for detail, and perseverance that web dev. has taught me, are accelerators in
                enabling me to achieve my goal of giving back to society and leaving my design footprint behind in this
                world. <br> <br>

                My goal is to become a Successfull web dev. & designer. I am passionate about creating something
                different. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited about the
                future possibilities in web Developement. <br> <br>
